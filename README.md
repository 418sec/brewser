brewser
=======

Brewser is a ruby library for parsing and generating serialized brewing data

Currently brewser is very early in development but will eventually support the following input formats:
* [BeerXML (v1, v2)](http://beerxml.org)
* BrewSON - Brewser Recipe and Batches in JSON
* [ProMash (.rec and text exports)](http://www.promash.com)

Input files are deserialized into a common object model for consumption.  Brewser supports these output formats:
* BeerXML
* BrewSON
